School research project
--------------
I created this package for my school research project. I want to create an AI that can predict if a human where to get a heart failure. For this I created a very long python file but I wanted to make this easier to understand. So, I created this package to get a shorter file and make it easier to understand.

How to use
--------------
1. Import the package --- "from zeroone_ai import MLPRegressor"
